New ESM:
- DB contains 25+ players that develop over time and change from season to season (like stocks)
  - Roster will be added to as game scales
  - Each player will have a list of favorite champions they (randomly) choose from each season to play with
  - Champion determines lane they will play in (some champions work in multiple lanes)
- Each new season
  - Champion each player plays as randomizes
  - ELO for each player resets (visibly 1k, + or - 250 hidden)
- A standard ELO bump is now 4 hidden ELO, 8 visible ELO
- A player match consists of:
  - Champion a player matched up against [influences odds of winning]
  - Mood the player was in as they played (they win, mood goes up; they lose, mood goes down)
    - Motivated (7/7; doubles ELO gained while winning, loss is 0.25x standard)
    - Calm (4/7; ELO gained from a win is 1.5x standard ELO bump, loss is 0.5x standard)
    - Anxious (2/7; ELO gained from a win is 1.0x standard ELO bump, loss is 1.0x standard)
    - Bored (1/7; ELO gained from a win is 0.5x standard ELO bump, loss is 1.5x standard)
    - Apathetic (0/7; ELO gained from a win is 0.25x standard ELO bump, loss is 2x standard)
  - New algorithm to determine winning odds (vs opponent):
    - Champion who they face off accounts for 30%
    - Tier of their lane/champ combo accounts for 20%
    - difference in ELO accounts for 35% (opponent doesn't get this stat) [c = real - visible]
      - if c > 100, 35/35
      - else if c > 50, 25/35
      - else if c > 25, 15/35
      - else if c > -25, 5/35
      - else 0/35
    - Experience accounts for up to 15%
