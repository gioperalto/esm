## Tech Stack
### Backend (MEN)
1. Mongo/Mongoose
2. Express.js
3. NodeJS

### Frontend (P)
1. Pug

**App is currently coupled (frontend and backend are in the same app). It would be nice to decouple (separate frontend + backend) the application.**

## Startup (Initialization)
1. Launch mongodb instance (or cluster) and configure mongodb settings in config/database.js
2. Once mongo is running, you should be able to kick the app off with `npm start PORT=XXXX` or `node app PORT=XXXX` where X is a number
3. Web application will be available at http://localhost:PORT (defaults to 1337)

## Home Page
The home page provides links to the account creation, login, players, and rosters pages. These pages are public by default, however logging in will grant you access to additional pages.

## Players Page
On the players page you can see the active LoL players currently in the league. These players are generated by the system and are not real. By viewing their profile, you can see a player's story, their favorite champions, their age, and even their stats (wins, losses, etc.).
