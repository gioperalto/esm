It is designed to mimic the MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with scalable, service-oriented architecture. It's especially good for building chat, realtime dashboards, or multiplayer games.\n\n## About Waterline\nhttp://github.com/balderdashy/waterline\n\nWaterline is a new kind of storage and retrieval engine.  It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs.  That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in mySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.\n\n[![githalytics.com alpha](https://cruel-carlota.pagodabox.com/a22d3919de208c90c898986619efaa85 \"githalytics.com\")](http://githalytics.com/balderdashy/sails-dirty)\n\n",
