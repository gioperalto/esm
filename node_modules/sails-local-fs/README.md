# sails-local-fs

Streaming binary upload/download adapter for a server's local filesystem

> #### IMPORTANT NOTE
> The blob adapter specification is still a work in progress, and may change dramatically.
> This blob store integration itself, along with `file-parser` and `waterline-blob` are very much still alpha-ware.
> The spec will harden, and barring any unforeseen circumstances, we should be able to officially release these adapters by the end of 2013.
>
> If you'd still like to try it out, see the example here: https://github.com/mikermcneil/stream-debug
> And you can learn more about the adapter interface spec here: https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/0.9/api.adapter-interface.md
